    "A troubled security guard begins working at Freddy Fazbear's Pizzeria. While spending his first night on the job, he realizes the late shift at Freddy's won't be so easy to make it through. During his five nights on the job, he realizes that something is wrong with the pizzeria and pretty soon finds the truth about its animatronics. <a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4589218/plotsummary/#:~:text=Synopsis%20(1)%20Edit-,Summaries,the%20truth%20about%20its%20animatronics.' target='_blank'>Read more on IMDb</a>"

        "I really enjoyed the movie mainly because I watched it with my friends. Overall I found the plot to be thrilling as it there were different turn of events that were unexpected. This also led me into a rabbit hole about the lore of the game series: FNAF. I also really liked the character's flashback as its able to explain why a character acts this way or does a certain thing."
